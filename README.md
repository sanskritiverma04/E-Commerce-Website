# E-Commerce-Website
An e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS would feature essential functionalities like product listings, a search bar, and an add-to-cart option. The product listings display each product's image, name, price, and description. The search functionality allows users to find specific products quickly. The add-to-cart feature enables users to select items for purchase, with a cart component showing the selected items, allowing modifications, and calculating the total price. The website would also be designed responsively to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices. Using ReactJS, components like ProductList, ProductItem, SearchBar, and Cart would be created to manage these features efficiently.
